# FracFormer
FracFormer is a Transformer-based network designed for fracture reduction planning, utilizing point cloud data from fracture segmentation to estimate the target pose of bone fragments. It formulates the task as a patch-to-patch translation problem to reconstruct bone shapes. The network features a Fragment-Aware Patch Encoding (FAPE) module for extracting local features and embedding fragment labels, a patch morphing module for predicting geometric deformations and query embeddings, and a reconstruction module that integrates global and local features to generate dense point clouds for precise bone shape restoration.
